# Running NREL State Estimator Docker

## Load Docker image
First, download `gadal-example.tar.gz`.

Then run `docker load -i gadal-example.tar.gz`

To get a docker volume pointed at the right place locally, we have to create a directory and point a volume.
```
mkdir outputs_build
docker volume create --name gadal_output --opt type=none --opt device=$(pwd)/outputs_build --opt o=bind
```

To check that the docker volume was correct, run
```
âœ— docker volume inspect gadal_output
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2022-09-14T22:39:16Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/gadal_output/_data",
        "Name": "gadal_output",
        "Options": {
            "device": "{FULL PATH TO outputs_build DIRECTORY}",
            "o": "bind",
            "type": "none"
        },
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

Occasionally `pwd` substitution does not work, then you must specify the exact path. On windows, this will end up
being `/c/Users/.../outputs_builds/`. You must use forward slashes. Note that you will need to delete the image
if necessary with `docker image rm gadal_output` before recreating it.

## Run with Docker Image

Then we can run the docker image:
```
docker run --rm --mount source=gadal_output,target=/simulation/outputs gadal-example:0.0.0
```

## Analysis

The `outputs_build` directory should contain `.feather` and `.csv` files describing the output.

- `voltage_real` and `voltage_imag` are the "true" voltages from OpenDSS
- `voltage_mag` and `voltage_angle` are the outputs from the state estimator

The `post_analysis.py` script computes relative error for magnitude (MAPE) and angle in percentage (MAE). Plots of errors over time and bus number is also produced.

To run on the correct docker file, use
```
python post_analysis.py outputs_build
```
